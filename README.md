# Landlordy

A web app that connects Landlord with confirmed tenants. Landlords are able to create an account, create properties, and send tenant invites.
Once an tenant accepts the invite from the landlord, the tenant is now associated with the landlord's property. The tenant can send rent payments and maintenance requests.
